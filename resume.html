                Wrote and maintained the first version of the real time inference server backing up AXON-2.
			</li>
			<li>
                Rewrote and maintained an internal file based in memory cache, similar to LevelDB or RocksDB. Used Go.
			</li>
			<li>

			<h3>Machine Zone, Inc, now part of AppLovin.</h3>
			<em style="padding: 10px;">Palo Alto, California - Staff Software Engineer: January 2016--September 2020</em>
			<ul >
			<li>
                Wrote a real time <a href="https://github.com/machinezone/cobra">messaging system</a>, Cobra, used mainly for game analytics, with message dispatching built on top of Redis Streams. Cobra handles 50,000 1K messages per seconds at peak, is running on kubernetes and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8CC8qYfRQE&t=436s">presented</a> at the Redis conference in 2019. The system was used for performance monitoring and game usage analytics. Worked to spread Cobra usage accross departments, which lead to some important new use cases such as live code or asset reloading for development and lua <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame graphs</a> creation used to find performance bottlenecks.
			</li>
			<li>
                Wrote a python <a href="https://github.com/machinezone/rcc/tree/master/rcc">redis client</a> library and a companion tool which can be used to monitor key space usage and do an <a href="https://bsergean.github.io/binpacking/">optimal resharding</a> of a redis cluster, using a bin packing algorithm. This work was selected to be presented at Redis Conf 2020 and will be presented in a redislabs Webinar.
			</li>
			<li>
                Rewrote the chat and the real time system networking layer on top of a WebSocket transport with MessagePack data marshalling instead of XMPP. The protocol is implemented in lua which makes it very easy to update, unlike the previous implementation. The C++ WebSocket implementation was open-sourced and is used by <a href="https://github.com/machinezone/IXWebSocket/stargazers">many users</a>, and contains a client and server library, and an HTTP 1.1 client and server. The library is available on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/ixwebsocket">vcpkg</a> and the companion busy-box like <a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86_64/ws">networking tool</a> is packaged for Alpine Linux.
			</li>
			<li>
                Worked on fast asset delivery to improve the first time user experience of our games. Introduced the usage of binary patching to transfer file deltas and reduce the transfered payload by 10 to 20x. Reworked the localization file formats to be more compact and benefit from binary patching. Implemented C++ client and Python build part for both changes. Developed a python tool used to replicate a complex C++ engine code base and calculate offline the amount of downloaded asset data required to login into our games, which is used to validate each game release.
			</li>
			<li>
                Fixed a long standing nasty luajit bug which was responsible for 90% of all the Android crashes, which required a multi-month backward compatible rollout process. Due to its high frequency the bug had been thought to be a memory pressure crash while it was not.
			</li>
			<li>
                Re-architected the crash handling and reporting tool by creating a bridge from the game clients to <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">sentry</a>, with extra native C/C++ crash support. Open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/machinezone/stackwalker">stack walking</a> code which served as a reference implementation of sentry builtin latter support, and added many features such as handling of lua and java crashes and displaying code snippets alongside backtrace information which made fixing some bugs trivial. Devops of associated services, container migration and switched to sentry saas in 2019. This work was rewarded by an internal technical achievement award.

			<h3>DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc.</h3>
			<em style="padding: 10px;">Redwood City, California - Software Engineer: May 2010--December 2015</em>
			<ul >
			<li>
			Working on moonlight, an off-line software renderer. The renderer is the software computing final images that people see on screen. Wrote an analytic web tool for render logs, processing hundred of millions of events on a single machine using a custom database engine.
			</li>
			<li>
			Worked on torch, the next generation lighting software, used to lit Turbo, How to train your Dragons 2 and all Dreamworks movies going forward. Scrum lead of the team owning the 3D Viewer, the curve editor, the interface with the Renderer.
			</li>
			<li>
			Lead of the torch show reactive team, working on bugs and optimizations requested by shows with fast turnaround. Optimized a regioning workflow operation which on a large crowd scene was taking 15 minutes to run and was consuming 10 Gigabytes of memory. Reduced it to a runtime of 0.2 seconds and a memory consumption of 300M (4500x speedup / 30x memory reduction).
			</li>
			<li>
			Wrote an analytic web tool for monitoring the stability of torch. The tool was later expanded to support the animation, the rig and the rendering softwares. The tool was given an internal tech award; tech awards are usually given to work leading to patents or published papers.
			</li>
			<li>
			Wrote a prediction/error compression system for baked animated sequences (Surfaces and Meshes), reducing the disk
			footprint by 10x on average and 20 to 30x on best case. Integrated the system in Dreamworks pipeline.
			</li>
			<li>
			Reworked the polygonal/subdivision surfaces file format and shrunk disk usage by 15% to 25% 
			with simple and efficient techniques while maintaining it lossless and backward compatible.
			The prototype was written in Python (full re-implementation of the file format IO).
			</li>
			<li>
			Lots of cleanup and improvements to the very rich Dreamworks geometric toolset
			(command lines, operators, Python/C++ binding, 3D viewers).
