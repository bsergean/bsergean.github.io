What looked like the most solid one, websocketpp did depend on boost and this was not an option for us. Secondly, there were other available libraries with fewer dependencies (C ones), but they required calling an explicit poll routine periodically to know if a client had received data from a server, which was not elegant.

[7.0.0] - 2019-10-01 TLS support in server code, only implemented for the OpenSSL SSL backend for now. [6.3.4] - 2019-09-30 all ws subcommands propagate tls options to servers (unimplemented) or ws or http client (implemented) (contributed by Matt DeBoer) [6.3.3] - 2019-09-30 ws has a --version option [6.3.2] - 2019-09-29 (http + websocket clients) can specify cacert and some other tls options (not implemented on all backend). This makes it so that server certs can finally be validated on windows. [6.3.1] - 2019-09-29 Add ability to use OpenSSL on apple platforms. [6.3.0] - 2019-09-28 ixcobra / fix crash in CobraConnection::publishNext when the queue is empty + handle CobraConnection_PublishMode_Batch in CobraMetricsThreadedPublisher [6.2.9] - 2019-09-27 mbedtls fixes / the unittest now pass on macOS, and hopefully will on Windows/AppVeyor as well. [6.2.8] - 2019-09-26 Http server: add options to ws https to redirect all requests to a given url. POST requests will get a 200 and an empty response. ws httpd -L --redirect_url https://www.google.com [6.2.7] - 2019-09-25 Stop having ws send subcommand send a binary message in text mode, which would cause error in make ws_test shell script test. [6.2.6] - 2019-09-24 Fix 2 race conditions detected with TSan, one in CobraMetricsPublisher::push and another one in WebSocketTransport::sendData (that one was bad). [6.2.5] - 2019-09-23 Add simple Redis Server which is only capable of doing publish / subscribe. New ws redis_server sub-command to use it. The server is used in the unittest, so that we can run on CI in environment where redis isn not available like github actions env. [6.2.4] - 2019-09-22 Add options to configure TLS ; contributed by Matt DeBoer. Only implemented for OpenSSL TLS backend for now. [6.2.3] - 2019-09-21 Fix crash in the Linux unittest in the HTTP client code, in Socket::readBytes Cobra Metrics Publisher code returns the message id of the message that got published, to be used to validated that it got sent properly when receiving an ack.

Windows note To use the network system on Windows, you need to initialize it once with WSAStartup() and clean it up with WSACleanup() . We have helpers for that which you can use, see below. This init would typically take place in your main function. #include <ixwebsocket/IXNetSystem.h> int main() { ix::initNetSystem(); ... ix::uninitNetSystem(); return 0; } WebSocket client API #include <ixwebsocket/IXWebSocket.h> ... # Our websocket object ix::WebSocket webSocket; std::string url(\"ws://localhost:8080/\"); webSocket.setUrl(url); // Optional heart beat, sent every 45 seconds when there is not any traffic // to make sure that load balancers do not kill an idle connection. webSocket.setHeartBeatPeriod(45); // Per message deflate connection is enabled by default.

If the connection was closed and sending failed, the return value will be set to false. ReadyState getReadyState() returns the state of the connection. There are 4 possible states. ReadyState::Connecting - The connection is not yet open. ReadyState::Open - The connection is open and ready to communicate. ReadyState::Closing - The connection is in the process of closing. ReadyState::Closed - The connection is closed or could not be opened. Open and Close notifications The onMessage event will be fired when the connection is opened or closed. This is similar to the Javascript browser API , which has open and close events notification that can be registered with the browser addEventListener . webSocket.setOnMessageCallback([](const ix::WebSocketMessagePtr& msg) { if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Open) { std::cout << \"send greetings\" << std::endl; // Headers can be inspected (pairs of string/string) std::cout << \"Handshake Headers:\" << std::endl; for (auto it : msg->headers) { std::cout << it.first << \": \" << it.second << std::endl; } } else if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Close) { std::cout << \"disconnected\" << std::endl; // The server can send an explicit code and reason for closing. // This data can be accessed through the closeInfo object. std::cout << msg->closeInfo.code << std::endl; std::cout << msg->closeInfo.reason << std::endl; } } ); Error notification A message will be fired when there is an error with the connection.

Configuring the remote url The url can be set and queried after a websocket object has been created. You will have to call stop and start if you want to disconnect and connect to that new url. std::string url(\"wss://example.com\"); websocket.configure(url); Ping/Pong support Ping/pong messages are used to implement keep-alive. 2 message types exists to identify ping and pong messages. Note that when a ping message is received, a pong is instantly send back as requested by the WebSocket spec. webSocket.setOnMessageCallback([](const ix::WebSocketMessagePtr& msg) { if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Ping || msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Pong) { std::cout << \"pong data: \" << msg->str << std::endl; } } ); A ping message can be sent to the server, with an optional data string. websocket.ping(\"ping data, optional (empty string is ok): limited to 125 bytes long\"); Heartbeat. You can configure an optional heart beat / keep-alive, sent every 45 seconds when there is no any traffic to make sure that load balancers do not kill an idle connection. webSocket.setHeartBeatPeriod(45); Supply extra HTTP headers. You can set extra HTTP headers to be sent during the WebSocket handshake. WebSocketHttpHeaders headers; headers[\"foo\"] = \"bar\"; webSocket.setExtraHeaders(headers); Automatic reconnection Automatic reconnection kicks in when the connection is disconnected without the user consent.

Then, secure sockets are automatically used when connecting to a wss://* url. Additional TLS options can be configured by passing a ix::SocketTLSOptions instance to the setTLSOptions on ix::WebSocket (or ix::WebSocketServer or ix::HttpServer ) webSocket.setTLSOptions({ .certFile = \"path/to/cert/file.pem\", .keyFile = \"path/to/key/file.pem\", .caFile = \"path/to/trust/bundle/file.pem\" }); Specifying certFile and keyFile configures the certificate that will be used to communicate with TLS peers. On a client, this is only necessary for connecting to servers that require a client certificate. On a server, this is necessary for TLS support. Specifying caFile configures the trusted roots bundle file (in PEM format) that will be used to verify peer certificates. - The special value of SYSTEM (the default) indicates that the system-configured trust bundle should be used; this is generally what you want when connecting to any publicly exposed API/server. - The special value of NONE can be used to disable peer verification; this is only recommended to rule out certificate verification when testing connectivity. For a client, specifying caFile can be used if connecting to a server that uses a self-signed cert, or when using a custom CA in an internal environment. For a server, specifying caFile implies that: 1. You require clients to present a certificate 1. It must be signed by one of the trusted roots in the file WebSocket server API #include <ixwebsocket/IXWebSocketServer.h> ... // Run a server on localhost at a given port. // Bound host name, max connections and listen backlog can also be passed in as parameters. ix::WebSocketServer server(port); server.setOnConnectionCallback( [&server](std::shared_ptr<WebSocket> webSocket, std::shared_ptr<ConnectionState> connectionState) { webSocket->setOnMessageCallback( [webSocket, connectionState, &server](const ix::WebSocketMessagePtr msg) { if (msg->type == ix::WebSocketMessageType::Open) { std::cerr << \"New connection\" << std::endl; // A connection state object is available, and has a default id // You can subclass ConnectionState and pass an alternate factory // to override it.
