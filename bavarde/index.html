# Chat like a nerd

<img src="demo_chat.svg" />

The bavarde chat client, coming with [cobra](https://github.com/machinezone/cobra/) got some improvements.

## It works (tm)

First thing, it works. For the longuest time the server hosting the cobra server was down. It ran on GCP (google cloud platform), then Openshift, but I could not figure out the reverse proxy on openshift, so I was still using GCP, only to proxy to Openshift, pretty silly. Running on GCP turned out to be a bit overkill for a hobby chat, and not as cheap as I wished. So I abandonned it for multiple months, but then was motivated enough to bring it back. Now it is running 'old school' on a Linode micro box, which is plenty enough for now. I love Linode. I picked Alpine Linux 3.11 as the distro. 

### Security note

Dont forget to harden your SSH access after setting up your machine ; as one of the Linode folk said, the internet is a wild place. I left that for later ... and got a notification from the Linode support that my machine had been used for port scanning ... :( Here are some [steps](https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server/) to follow to secure a server.

## TLS aka SSL

```
$ curl https://jeanserge.com                                            

   ___      _

Cobra is a realtime messaging server using Python3, WebSockets and Redis.

Version 2.9.7
Running on localhost
Start time 2020-04-21 05:17:21
    
$ cobra health --endpoint wss://jeanserge.com --rolesecret ccc02DE4Ed8CAB9aEfC8De3e13BfBE5E --rolename pubsub --appkey _pubsub
Client version: 2.9.11
Server version: 2.9.7
System is healthy
```

I configured TLS properly for the first time on a server of mine. I got the certificate using letsencrypt. The way it works is that you need to store a file somewhere on a path accessible by an http server (nginx in my case), and a remote server will try to fetch it to make sure you really own a host. This is driven by a tool called cerbot. There is more automation but the manual mode will just give you a certificate available for 3 months I believe.

Cobra, which is a websocket server, is running behind nginx which handles the TLS encryption. I use a normal redis instance.

## OS notifications

<img src="os_notifications.png" />

Those are provided through a python module named [klaxon](https://github.com/knowsuchagency/klaxon). It is the little popup that shows up in the right hand side.

## Daemon

To get those notification, you need to run a daemon (`bavarde daemon`) which will fork twice and be dettached from your terminal. This also thanks to a nice python module that does the hard work for you.

### Sleepwatcher

However I wasn't sure on how the daemon would work when my laptop goes to sleep ; it sounds safer to restart it when the computer wake up, and stop it when it goes to sleep. The downside is that if a message is received while I'm away I won't know about it, unless I add something in the protocol to 'mark' messages as read somehow. Googling for a Python module didn't get me anywhere (I found some gist that required to use pyobjc ... too much dependencies). Instead I'm using a little package named sleepwatcher, available through homebrew.

```
$ brew install sleepwatcher
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/sleepwatcher-2.2.1.catalina.bottle.tar.gz
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring sleepwatcher-2.2.1.catalina.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
For SleepWatcher to work, you will need to read the following:

  /usr/local/opt/sleepwatcher/ReadMe.rtf

Ignore information about installing the binary and man page,
but read information regarding setup of the launchd files which
are installed here:

  /usr/local/opt/sleepwatcher/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility-localuser.plist
      /usr/local/opt/sleepwatcher/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility.plist

These are the examples provided by the author.

To have launchd start sleepwatcher now and restart at login:
  brew services start sleepwatcher
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/sleepwatcher/2.2.1: 9 files, 60.4KB
```

I just need to edit the local user one.

```
brew services start sleepwatcher
```

Then I created a ~/.wakeup and a ~/.sleep file. The wakeup script will kill the existing bavarde daemon, if any, and start a fresh one. The sleep script will kill the existing daemon.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

#
# Wake up scripts, only used by bavarde / cobra
#

# Set path
export PATH=$HOME/src/foss/cobra/venv/bin:$PATH

# We should log all actions for debugging
LOG_FILE=/tmp/sleepwatcher.my.log

echo "WAKING UP at `date`" >> $LOG_FILE
echo >> $LOG_FILE

# list Python processes
echo >> $LOG_FILE
echo "Python processes before daemon restart..." >> $LOG_FILE
echo >> $LOG_FILE
ps -ef | grep Python >> $LOG_FILE

# Kill the daemon, if any
echo "killing python up at `date`" >> $LOG_FILE
kill -9 `cat /tmp/bavarde.pid`

# Sleep
sleep 1

# Restart the daemon
bavarde daemon

# Sleep
sleep 1

# Look at processes
echo >> $LOG_FILE
echo "Python processes after daemon restart..." >> $LOG_FILE
echo >> $LOG_FILE
ps -ef | grep Python >> $LOG_FILE
echo "done\n" >> $LOG_FILE
```

## CPU running wild

My machine was getting warm, and I had a hard time figuring out why ; it turns
out I had a very busy loop which could be rewritten a different way ... I have
spent a lot of time in that code and I can't seem to get code that can receive
a lot of messages fast, without pegging the CPU and having a predictable memory
usage. I discovered that by using a new out of process python profiler named
[py-spy](https://pypi.org/project/py-spy/), written in Rust. I could not run
this one on Alpine unfortunately, as dealing with rust, or linux manywheel
package and musl is usually a headache.

Here is the [bug
fix](https://github.com/machinezone/cobra/commit/db7691f593a8eeac99a65d0dd8582fcc63de52d1)
for those interested in asyncio. We can see that we are spending a lot of time inside *getActionResponse*. The py-spy output is super helpful, it is similar to the Linux perf tool, or plain old UNIX top.
