# IXWebSocket ws utility available in Alpine Linux

<img src="Alpine_Linux.svg" />

The [IXWebSocket](https://github.com/machinezone/IXWebSocket) library comes with a command line tool that can do a lot of things, a client and server for HTTP and WebSocket, a simple redis pubsub client and server, a cobra client and server, a proxy. Some code works better than other :) and there are still many bugs ; it takes a lot of work to make a proper HTTP proxy !

What is remarkable is that, if you are lucky it is very easy to work with the packaging creators. The workflow work with gitlab pull requests, which is more modern and easier than doing something similar with debian or fedora, where the overhead of packaging something is overwhelming. Another package manager OS which seems to be easier to is [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/), as the flow works with github pull requests.
