# Disabling a very annoying vi feature

<img src="flashing.jpg" />

While I am editing something with my favoite editor, vi, I am used to
frantically pressing the Escape key to be a hundred per cent sure I am out of
insert mode in vi, but when running vim inside a terminal this leads to the
screen flashing terribly at me. There is also a beep sounds that can be heard,
with the wrong config.

Here is the magic it takes to disable this behavior.

```
" Disable visual bell
" This is explained in the documentation of 'visualbell'
set visualbell
set t_vb=
```

Thanks you stack overflow once again, where I found that dark
[incantation](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5310/how-can-i-disable-bells-visualbells-in-vim).
I should start contributing to it, at least so that I can upvotes some good
answers.

As a side note if you are a vi user and you wished you could use vi navigation
in your terminal, it is possible. It works quite well with zsh. All you need to
do is adding that to your .zshrc file.

```
bindkey -v
```
