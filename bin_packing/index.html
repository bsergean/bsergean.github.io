# Bin Packing, Redis Cluster and Cobra

## Bin Packing


The [bin packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) is about optimizing the distribution of weighted items to bins. Multiple variants exists, but our focus in this post is on distributing weights into a fixed number of bins. I like to think about Santa Clauss getting ready to deliver its presents the day before Christmas, and having its elves preparing the reindeers carriages. We will imagine that many carriages are ready to be used, and that Santa will jump to a new one once he has delivered all the presents in his carriage.

The question is: *depending on the size of the presents boxes, how should we distribute the load so that each carreage is as evenly distributed as possible*? Luckily a Python [library](https://pypi.org/project/binpacking/) exists for this algorithm (as always ?), and the library interface is very simple and clear as it uses python dictionaries.

```
# We have 6 presents
b = { 'a': 10, 'b': 10, 'c':11, 'd':1, 'e': 2,'f':7 } # [name, weight] pairs, in a dictionary

# We want to pack them into 4 bins
# Assign each pair to its own bin, and return the list of bins as a result
bins = binpacking.to_constant_bin_number(b, 4)

# Print the result. Excuse the ugly uppercase Bin, but bin is a reserved function in Python
for Bin in bins:
    # We will print the sum of all the weights in the bin, along with the bin itself
    print(sum(Bin.values()), Bin)
```

Executing this program prints this on the console:

```
11 {'c': 11}
10 {'b': 10}
10 {'a': 10}
10 {'f': 7, 'e': 2, 'd': 1}
```

We have 4 bins with a weight of 10 or 11, so things are pretty well distributed. Now image that we were cycling through each objects in our original list of items b, and **picking the destination bin randomly**. The following program does that.

```
bins = [{} for _ in range(4)]     # Create 4 bins, each bin is a list of dictionaries

for name, weight in b.items():
    binIdx = random.randint(0,3)  # pick a random integer between 0 and 3
    bins[binIdx][name] = weight   # insert a 'present' into a bin
```

Let's run this 3 times.

```
# First try
9 {'e': 2, 'f': 7}
1 {'d': 1}
31 {'a': 10, 'b': 10, 'c': 11}
0 {}

# Second try
12 {'a': 10, 'e': 2}
18 {'c': 11, 'f': 7}
11 {'b': 10, 'd': 1}
0 {}

# Third try
0 {}
22 {'b': 10, 'c': 11, 'd': 1}
2 {'e': 2}
17 {'a': 10, 'f': 7}
```

This is pretty terrible, however this is what randomly picking an item will give you.

## Redis Cluster

<img src="hash_slots.png" />

To quote its documentation, *Redis Cluster provides a way to run a Redis installation where data is automatically sharded across multiple Redis nodes*. [Redis cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial) isn't only about sharding, but this is what we will focus on.

Every time you store something in Redis Cluster, it all starts by hashing the key of your object with a CRC16, modulo something, and that hash assign your key to a slot, called a *hash slot*. There are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster. A good hash function should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over its output range, that is 16384 hash slots in our case. That propery is called [uniformity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function#Uniformity).

Each node in a cluster is responsible for a range of hash slots, and that assignment is usually done automatically early on, but the power of this system is that the assignment can be manual as well. If you know of a great way to distribute your hash slots to nodes, you can arrange for an optimal load balancing, and keep each redis nodes as busy as possible.

**Just like you wouldn't want to have some reindeers do more work than other, you would not want some redis machine have little work to do, while others are crazy busy**.

## Cobra

[Cobra](https://github.com/machinezone/cobra) is a real time messaging system,
which we mainly use at [Machine Zone](https://www.mz.com/) for analytics. It
uses Redis internally, and store metrics events as JSON blobs into redis
streams.

Cobra internally keep statistics about all channels, which helps us know which
ones are high frequency. This is displayed in the table below, along the redis
hash slot for a given channel name. We can notice that the CRC16 gives unique
hash for all our sample keys. We can also see that the distribution of published
items by channel name is uneven. If we were to randomly pick a channel and have
it processed by a random Redis node, *that would lead to inefficiencies*.

```

Let's try to do the channel to hash slot assignment randomly, as it would be done if we were not assigning hash slots to redis nodes manually.

### Random distribution 1

```
537399 {'niso_engine_rml_navigation_id': 485541, 'niso_game_lua_health_minutes': 43157, 'niso_game_pubsub_events_id': 8701}

stdev 376758.0808394682
```

We will represent this visually, using a pie chart. The excellent [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library can plot this for us.

```
labels = ['1', '2', '3', '4']
S = sum(weights)
sizes = [100 * weight / S for weight in weights]
colors = ['yellowgreen', 'gold', 'lightskyblue', 'lightcoral']
patches, texts = plt.pie(sizes, colors=colors, shadow=True, startangle=90)
plt.legend(patches, labels, loc="best")
plt.axis('equal')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This is pretty bad... Ideally we would want to see a pie chart with 4 somewhat equal quadrants.

However, if we can find in which hash slot each channel traffic will land, and use the published count as a weight for that channel, **we can allocate that channel to be handled by a Redis Cluster node using the Bin Packing algorithm**. This will give us a **fair or optimal** load balancing.

2 Redis commands are required to do that:

* The [CLUSTER KEYSLOT](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-keyslot) command run the CRC16 hash on a key.
* The [CLUSTER SETSLOT](https://redis.io/commands/cluster-keyslot) command run will be used to allocate a hash slot to a redis cluster node. Practically speaking, it is easier to use the redis-cli command which can do that for us, and handle the resharding better. Here are all the things that the CLI can do for you.

```

Back to the bin-packing algorithm, let's see how it performs on our own real data set, which is a less contrived than the one we used in our first example.

### Bin packing distribution

```
677400 {'niso_engine_net_request_id': 677400}
503781 {'niso_engine_rml_navigation_id': 485541, 'niso_game_pubsub_events_id': 8701, 'niso_engine_set_asset_build_id': 4339, 'niso_engine_message_loop_id': 4251, 'niso_game_logging_id': 685, 'niso_game_lua_health_mem_warning': 264}
503736 {'niso_engine_rml_load_document_metrics_id': 360998, 'niso_engine_fps_id': 46889, 'niso_engine_memory_used_id': 46745, 'niso_engine_memory_warning_id': 14714, 'niso_engine_lifecycle_id': 13444, 'niso_game_chat_events_id': 9307, 'niso_engine_net_request_error_id': 4356, 'niso_engine_graphics_device_info': 4284, 'niso_game_lua_health_threshold': 2410, 'niso_game_unexpected_termination_id': 518, 'niso_game_user_actions_id': 46, 'niso_engine_crash_id': 16, 'niso_sms_set_rate_control_id': 7, 'niso_engine_selfupdate_storage_error_id': 2}
504281 {'niso_game_lua_health_id': 176710, 'niso_engine_payload_id': 163277, 'niso_game_noisytypes_id': 103027, 'niso_game_lua_health_minutes': 43157, 'niso_engine_performance_metrics_id': 5585, 'niso_engine_set_cdn_idx_id': 4392, 'niso_engine_net_traffic_id': 4322, 'niso_engine_rocket_log_id': 3811}
```

Our 4 bins receive around 500,000 units of weight each. If we visualize this with a pie-chart, this feels like a pretty fair repartition.

## Success !!

## Conclusion

If you can analyze *efficiently your key space*, the *flexible* Redis Cluster hash slot design let you do wonder and achieve an excellent *load balancing*. This leads to less CPU cycles burnt for nothing, which leads to melting the ice cap a bit slowly, which in turn lead to allowing Santa to still be able to live in the North Pole in the foreseable future.
