On a high traffic subscription, I discovered that the --resume_from_last_position option triggered a big memory leak. Without it we can receive a decent amount of messages per second.

When using that option, the subscriber will write back into cobra the position of the last message that got read, so that in case of a crash the subscription can resume and not lose messages. It turns out that doing the write operation however ... slows down the subscriber, which leads to a lot of messages being buffered, memory increased and bots being killed by kubernete as they OOM. BTW, did you know that cobra can act as a Key/Value store ?

The fix (that still need some polish) is to make that write operation work happen concurrently in an asyncio task. Otherwise the IO operation will block other tasks, which has a bad consequence here. It is fixed in cobra 2.2.4. Ironically Loris Cro was [bloging](https://redislabs.com/blog/async-await-programming-basics-python-examples/) about something similar recently.

             if ret == ActionFlow.STOP:

```

There is still a small performance penalty when using that option, but the memory stays constant, and we can move on to another problem ... :)
