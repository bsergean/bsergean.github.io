# Embedding Python in C/C++.

There are times when you have an existing C++ application, for performance or
legacy reason, where it would be very convenient to write small chunk of it, or
extend it with a simple to use scripting language. Not everyone knows C++ and
building or working with it can be a pain. Python is great for that as its
syntax is very clear, it is battery included, and its main implementation is
written in C which makes embedding it easy.

That use case recently came out for
[cobra](https://machinezone.github.io/cobra/), and I'm almost done rewriting
some bits of my C++ code into Python. The C++ code that embed Python is
[here](https://github.com/machinezone/IXWebSocket/blob/master/ixbots/ixbots/IXCobraToPythonBot.cpp),
as part of cobra bot framework.

Python has a very good
[documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html) on doing
this as part of its C API, but this walk through should help explaining the
process even further.

## Linking with Python

Your first task will be to link with the Python runtime and find headers. Today
CMake is the most ubiquitous solution for building and there are simple
directives to do that.

```
find_package(Python COMPONENTS Development)
if (NOT Python_FOUND)
  message(FATAL_ERROR "Python not found")
endif()
message("Python_FOUND:${Python_FOUND}")
message("Python_VERSION:${Python_VERSION}")
message("Python_Development_FOUND:${Python_Development_FOUND}")
message("Python_LIBRARIES:${Python_LIBRARIES}")

# Then link with ${Python_LIBRARIES} and add ${Python_INCLUDE_DIRS} to your header search path
```

## Initializing Python

You initialize the Python runtime with Py_InitializeEx. In my use case I pass
in the 0 as the first argument, as this prevents Python from installing its
signal handler which breaks the class Ctrl-C behavior to interrupt my program.

If there is an error at any point calling Python functions, you should call
PyErr_Print() to get the details.

## Importing your module

You module is a path on disk, where the .py extension is stripped. Also make
sure you follow the normal loading module rules, do not put a dash in your file
name for example. You will have to set the PYTHONPATH for your module to be
found, to keep it simple I set the current working directory to the place where
the python script lives, and then set to the current folder with PYTHONPATH=.

```
PyObject* pyModuleName = PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault(modulePath.c_str());

if (pyModuleName == nullptr)
{
    CoreLogger::error("Python error: Cannot decode file system path");
    PyErr_Print();
    return false;
}

// Import module
PyObject* pyModule = PyImport_Import(pyModuleName);
Py_DECREF(pyModuleName);
if (pyModule == nullptr)
{
    CoreLogger::error("Python error: Cannot import module.");
    CoreLogger::error("Module name cannot countain dash characters.");
    CoreLogger::error("Is PYTHONPATH set correctly ?");
    PyErr_Print();
    return false;
}
```

## Defining an interface and loading your function

You will need to define the name of the function you want to call. I choose
**run**. The function takes 2 arguments and returns a list of dictionaries. The
first argument is a version number which I can bump in case I want to change
the interface or the rather the function signature. For example I would like to
not pass a serialized json string, but a dictionary or a normal python object,
but I have a memory leak at this point when I do so...

```
def run(version: int, serializedJson: str) -> list:
    # json parse str
    # extract some parameters
    # do some computation
    # ... all in python
    # then return that result
    return [{"kind": "counter", "key": "foo.bar.baz", "value": 12}]
```

The first step will be to load your function with PyObject_GetAttrString, and
verify that this symbol is a function.

```
// module main funtion name is named 'run'
const std::string entryPoint("run");
PyObject* pyFunc = PyObject_GetAttrString(pyModule, entryPoint.c_str());

if (!pyFunc)
{
    CoreLogger::error("run symbol is missing from module.");
    PyErr_Print();
    return false;
}

if (!PyCallable_Check(pyFunc))
{
    CoreLogger::error("run symbol is not a function.");
    PyErr_Print();
    return false;
}
```

## Calling your function

The function arguments are defined as a tuple. You should be able to pass
kwargs** kind of arguments as well, but I did not choose to do that.

PyTuple_New is used to create the tuple, and PyTuple_SetItem is used to set its
entries. Finally PyObject_CallObject is used to invoke the function.

```
//
// Invoke python script here. First build function parameters, a tuple
//
const int kVersion = 1; // We can bump this and let the interface evolve

PyObject *pyArgs = PyTuple_New(2);
PyTuple_SetItem(pyArgs, 0, PyLong_FromLong(kVersion)); // First argument

//
// It would be better to create a Python object (a dictionary)
// from the json msg, but it is simpler to serialize it to a string
// and decode it on the Python side of the fence
//
PyObject* pySerializedJson = PyUnicode_FromString(msg.toStyledString().c_str());
PyTuple_SetItem(pyArgs, 1, pySerializedJson); // Second argument

// Invoke the python routine
PyObject* pyList = PyObject_CallObject(pyFunc, pyArgs);
```

## Capturing the output

If something failed, PyObject_CallObject will return NULL. Calling
PyErr_Print() will often show you a syntax error or a runtime error.

Now in the happy case, you will have to extract the function return value, and
do something with it. In our case we want to send some data to statsd with
our own UDP C++ code. We use the entries in the dictionary to tell use which
kind of statsd event we want to send (a counter, a gauge or a timing), the name
of the key and the value.

```
// The result is a list of dict containing sufficient info
// to send messages to statsd
auto listSize = PyList_Size(pyList);

for (Py_ssize_t i = 0 ; i < listSize; ++i)
{
    PyObject* dict = PyList_GetItem(pyList, i);

    ... process each dict
```

The argument parsing is not very glorious code, and this is where binding
generators can prove useful for large code base, but in our case we keep it
simple and just use the normal Python function, and try to be careful, checking
object types and entry existence. Here is how to extract an entry from a
dictionary, check that it is a string and convert it to an std::string.

```
//
// Retrieve object key
//
PyObject* pyKey = PyDict_GetItemString(dict, "key");
if (!PyUnicode_Check(pyKey))
{
    fatalCobraError = true;
    CoreLogger::error("key entry is not a string");
    continue;
}
std::string key(PyUnicode_AsUTF8(pyKey));
```

Once all your data is represented in your own C++ data structure, you can just
call your function and be done with this.

```
if (counter)
{
    statsdClient.count(key, value);
}
else if (gauge)
{
    statsdClient.gauge(key, value);
}
else if (timing)
{
    statsdClient.timing(key, value);
}
```

## Conclusion

If the Python bits you are going to invoke will be slow (say 10 seconds), it is
OK to just shell out / fork and invoke the Python interpreter. The downside of
this approach is that passing arguments and capturing return value can be
tedious and expensive. You could run into limitation on the command line if you
need to pass a lot of data to Python, so usually you write arguments to temp
files, which you have to delete later, and if your program crash you have
leaked a resource. To capture output you will also need to so that as well. You
could use pipes, but then your program will nott be portable as pipe works very
differently on Windows and UNIX. It is not all shiny when embedding Python, but
at least there is an explicit API to do that, and it is more efficient to call
C program in process as opposed to shelling out. Game engines typically do
this, Unity does it with CSharp, many proprieatary engines embed lua which is a
fine choice too.

It is also possible to make a C python module, and call your C++ code directly from Python.
